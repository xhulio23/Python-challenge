# Python-challenge
In this challenge I was able to work on two fun activities called Pybank and Pypoll. On the Pybank excercise, I had to generate the following information such as 

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Unfortunately, after many attempts my code was unable to generate the following financial analysis. 

As per the Pybank excercise, I had to analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

With this excercise I was able to get the python script to work, which was a proud moment. 

In these exercises, I used the knowledge from all the class learnings, youtube tutorials and ChatGPT to generate some of the following codes to work.
